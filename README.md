## Description <a name="description"></a>
<sub>_***Built With:***_</sub> <sub>JavaScript,ES6,Node,Express.js,MySQL</sub> </br>
This was a bootcamp challenge to build the back end for an e-commerce site. With a given Express.js API, I configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. It was actually very straight forward. I didn't encounter any major hurdles. I see the value in using Sequilize, because it can speed up and ease the process, allowing javaScript developers to work with SQL databases. Also, it eliminates errors. I didn't hate working with MySQL in last weeks project, though. So, I am also interested in continuing to gain skills interacting with it as well.
